# tacc
## Multi-dimensional T-accounts implementation in Python

This module provides a pure-Python implementation of the T-accounts data strucutre used in Double-Entry accounting, as first described by Luca Pacioli in 1494 ("_Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni et proportionalita_"), as well as a multi-dimensional generalisation of the same (MDT), for convenient support of multi-currency / multi-unit bookkeeping. 

Provided is a sample auto-balancing Journal class, using either T or MDT accounts.
